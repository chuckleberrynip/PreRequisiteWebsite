	<h2><u>What is this website</u>:</h2>
	<h3>The objective of this website is to input your courses and then be able to know what courses you can take, without having to worry about prerequisites.</h3>
	<h2><u>Who is this website for?</u></h2>
	<h3>This website is intended for students who are unsure about how they should plan out their college careers, academically, at any point in time, however that being said 
		this website is open to anyone who wants to know what courses are available to anyone. It can also be a recommended resource when a person is unsure what kind of 
		position that they are in.</h3>
    <h2><u>Why are there only some majors and not others? Are they not as important?</u></h2>
    <h3>The objective of this project is to have a concept where the problem concerning what courses to take is solved. Although the solution presented may not be perfect, 
        it does remedy the issue to some degree. The reason why only a select few majors have been chosen, is due to me being a single person. However, I did my best to 
        make sure that adding new majors is fairly easy. The most amount of time when it comes to adding a major is definitely in gathering the relevant information and 
        then categorizing them.</h3>
    <h2><u>How do we add majors or minors?</u></h2>
    <h3>I would recommend going to the github page and the reading the provided guide as to how to add majors. The process is simple, however it does involve with dealing with
        code, but don't let that be a deterrent to engaging with the project.</h3>
    <h2><u>Is there a recommended way of using this website?</u></h2>
    <h3>Yes, please use a monitor with a 16x9 aspect ratio is at least 13 inches, unfortunately it looks really bad when not using those specifications. Also when inputting the 
        courses that you have taken, please make sure that you input them in order or else the output is going to have courses that are not relevant. </h3>
