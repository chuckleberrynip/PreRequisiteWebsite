# PreRequisiteWebsite
## Objective:
### To have an interactive website where people would be able to know what courses they can take.
## How does this work? 
#### Generally speaking, this website implements a topological sort in order to make sure that prerequisites are being met. So what the sort does is that it takes multiple arrays that represents lines that connects two nodes, or courses in this case, and depending which is the preceding and succeeding within the inner array will determine which is the prerequisite. This way, once the sort is done, the output is a list that contains a list of courses in the order that you should take them because that order will not have any issues regarding prerequisites. In this specific implementation, the array is represented as [PreRequisite, NextCourse], and this can be seen in the JSON file that contains all of the sorted major courses. So if we know that CISC 1115 is a prerequisite to CISC 3115 then within the JSON file in the relevant spot it would contain ["CISC 1115", "CISC 3115"] to indicate a relationship. The user has a table where they can input their courses and that removes those courses from the list, which leaves the courses that they have left to take and in the order that they should take them.
## How to add a new major or minor to the website? 
#### Although the process might seem very difficult, it is not. It can be approached by almost anybody and the only time-consumning aspect is organizing the information.
